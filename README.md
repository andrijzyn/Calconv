### This calculator is a simple yet effective tool that enables users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, on numbers with varying bases. 
### The result will be returned in the higher base between the two operands. Additionally, the script is capable of converting numbers from one base to another. 

### Explanation:
- **Operand and Base**: `operand_base` represents a number in the specified base. For example, `101_2` is 101 in binary.
- **Operator**: Supported operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.
- **Output Base**: The result will be displayed in the larger base of the two operands.

### With the recent update, an intuitive user interface (UI) has been added, enhancing user experience and making it easier to interact with the calculator.
