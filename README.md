# ðŸ§® bN: Converter and Calculator
The Python script is a simple yet effective tool that enables the user to perform fundamental arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, on numbers with varying bases and to return the result in the higher base between the two operands. Additionally, the script is capable of converting numbers from one base to another.
